# Coursera Specializations

This repo contains my personal notes and solutions to the programming assignments and are only for your reference. It may help you save some time, but I honestly feel that the assignments are not that hard and can be easily completed. 

List of Specializations:
- [Deep Learning (deeplearning.ai)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
- [AI for Medicine](https://coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine)
- [Advanced Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml)


If you need any help with the PA's, feel free to ping me anytime :)

Happy Learning!
