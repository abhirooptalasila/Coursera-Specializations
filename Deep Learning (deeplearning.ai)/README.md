# Deep Learning (deeplearning.ai)

The course is available at: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

This specialization has become one of my most favorite MOOCs because of [Andrew Ng's](http://www.andrewng.org/) simple way of teaching and the great course content.

- Course 1: **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**

- Course 2: **Improving Deep Neural Networks**

- Course 3: **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**

- Course 4: **Convolutional Neural Networks**

- Course 5: **Sequence Models**
